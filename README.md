# Covid19 Dashboard

This project is a place for me to experiment with streamlit and altair. 

The data are from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

To run it, from the project root folder:

1. Create and source a virtual environment

2. Install the package
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
3. Run the dashboard
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/covid19_dashboard/dashboard.py
   ```
